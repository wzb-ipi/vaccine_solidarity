abstract: "Respondents support high levels of cash and vaccine transfers to help poorer nations. They are more supportive when health and economic risks of failing to provide support are high; but for the most part support does not depend on these calculations. Preferences over German policy are largely independent of what other countries are doing. Median support for vaccines (90 million) and cash (2 billion) corresponds closely to actual  (100 million doses and 2.2 billion cash)."
